- vector maps of land use change: 1987 - 2018 (1987, 1997,  2003, 2008, 2014, 2018)
-

## to do 

- ~~fix maps (consistent land use category names; all labels in English; correct versions of maps)~~
- ~~upload DEM values~~
- ~~upload raster versions of land use ?~~
- fix excel file with climate info
- figure out how to:
    - aggregate/coarsen rasters (e.g. google "R reduce raster resolution")
	- derive transition tables (for each pair of years)
	- read the geospatial intro stuff (also https://rspatial.org/raster/analysis/index.html )
