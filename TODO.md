## TO DO

- Draw raster maps of land cover change?
- Figure out how to compute neighbourhood values in R
- Think about the appropriate scale on which to make predictions
- Would like to use something like the following predictors for probability of conversion to/from dune: altitude, slope, aspect (all computed from DEM); fraction of (at least) dune vs non-dune neighboring cells within a range of scales
- consider renaming climate variables to something easier to use in a model (no spaces, shorter names)
